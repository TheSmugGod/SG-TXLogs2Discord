TXAdmin Logs to Discord Webhook


this is a very simple python script that will monitor the tx logs and post them to a discord webhook,

change discord_webhook_url to your webhook
change log_file_path to where your tx admin logs are

you can also change the log file from fxserver.log to server.log or admin.log
fxserver.log is the live console , server.log is the player actions etc in game , and admin.log is self explanatory
